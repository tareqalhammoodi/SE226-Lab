Lab 1: Understanding basic input/output operations; the use of variables and arithmetic operators.

1. Create a Python project in which you have the following file: myFirstLabScript.py. This file will be your first Python script (also called a Python program or Python source code) that asks the user’s name, and then greets the user. After that, the program will ask the user to enter his/her student id. Lastly, it will print the id also.
```
'SAMPLE OUTPUT (bold parts are entered by user):
What is your name?
Ege
Hello Ege.
What is your Student ID? 20190120023
Your ID is 20190120023.'
```

2. Define two variables var1 and var2 and prompt the user to enter their values. Then, define three variables sum, diff, and prod, and assign to them the summation, difference and multiplication results of var1 and var2, respectively. Finally, display on the screen the values of var1, var2, sum, diff, and prod.

3. Assume that you are going to calculate a student’s last score for a course. You will take the name of the student first. Then, his/her lab grade (%25), midterm grade (%35) and lastly final grade (%40). Please store each value in a different variable. Calculate the last score of the student according to the given percentages and print it on the screen with his/her name. Your last output should be like this:
Name: Erdem Okur Lab: 80
Midterm: 90
Final: 50
Last Score: 71.5

4. Try to output the below asterisk pattern using the built-in function “print” only once.
```

```

5. Do the previous tasks again, but this time in C++ programming language. For variables, remember to specify their types. Python usually handles that for you, but C++ does not.
